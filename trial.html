    <h2>A House in The Sky</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time there lived a poor man, Abhilas by name. He was clever and often made jokes at rich people and even at the chief. So they did not like him and wanted to kill him. Once the chief sent for Abhilas and he came to the chief’s house.


"I hear that you are very clever, Abhilas! Can you build me a house in the sky in three days? You may have as many men as you need. If you can't do that my soldiers will kill you." 


"I shall build it, my Chief," said Abhilas and went home. 


He began to think. Then he made a kite and tied a bell and a long sting to it. When the wind blew, the kite rose high up in the air. 


But it did not fly far, because Abhilas tied the string to a tree. The next day all the people of the town heard the bell and saw a dark spot in the sky. The chief saw the spot, too. Abhilas came up to the chief and said" oh, my Chief, the house in the sky will soon be ready. Do you hear the bell? The workers are ringing the bell from the sky. They need some boards for the roof of the house. Please tell your soldiers to climb up to the sky with the boards." 


"But how will my soldiers climb up to the sky?" asked the chief.


"Oh, there is a way up," said Abhilas. 


So the chief ordered his soldiers to get some boards and to follow Abhilas. They came to the tree and saw the string there. "This is the way to the sky," Abhilas said. "Climb up the string and you will come to the sky." 


The soldiers tried to climb up the string, but could not do that. "Try again, try again! Our Chief will be very angry if you don't carry the boards up to his house in the sky!" said Abhilas. 


Then the soldiers went to the chief and said, "Oh, Chief, no man can climb up to the sky!"


The chief thought a little and said, "That's right. Nobody can do that." 


Then Abhilas said to the chief, "Oh, my Chief, if you know that, why do you ask me to build you a house in the sky?" 


And the chief could give no answer to that. Abhilas went to the tree, cut the string and took away the kite.</p>
    
        <h3>A Sly Cat</h3>
        <p>When he was a strong young cat, he caught many mice. The mice were afraid of him then. But in time he grew old and could not catch mice any more. 



One day he decided to play a trick on the mice. He lay on his back and did not move at all. 



A mouse saw him and thought he was dead. She ran to her friends and said, "The cat is dead! Let us dance and play!" 



And all the mice began to dance and play. They were very happy. They danced and danced round the cat and the cat did not move. 



Then one of the mice jumped on the cat's head. "Look at me! Come nearer, all of you! The bad cat is dead! Let us dance on his head!" But suddenly the cat jumped up and caught the silly mouse.



The other mice ran away as quickly as they could. 



Mice! Don't forget! Never believe a cat! </p>
    
        <h4>A Story about The Tongue</h4>
        <p>Once, a chief told one of his servants to bring him the best meat from the market. The servant brought him a tongue. The next day the chief told the servant to bring him the worst meat from the market. The servant brought a tongue again. "What?" the chief said. "When I ask for the best meat, you bring a tongue and then you bring the same thing for the worst meat." 



The servant said, "Sometimes a man is very unhappy because of his tongue and sometimes his tongue makes him very happy." 



"You are right," the chief said. "Let us be masters of our tongue!</p>
    
        <h5>Greedy Anansi</h5>
        <p>This is a story about a boy. His name was Anansi. There was a great famine in the country where Anansi lived. Anansi and his little brothers and sisters were very hungry. The boy could not think of anything but food. 


"This hunger will kill me!" he often said. 


One day he went out of the house and walked to the seashore. “I shall try to catch a little fish," he thought. 


He sat on the seashore watching, watching, watching - but nothing came. Then suddenly he saw a green island in the sea. Anansi climbed into a little red boat. And soon he came to the green island. He got out of the boat, stood under the tree and looked up at big nuts high above him. He tried to climb up the tree and get the nuts, but that was not easy. 


He tried again and again. But he could not get the nuts. The nuts were laughing at him! "I'll get you, my dear nuts!" he said. And he tried again and again to get the nuts. At last he got one nut. "Now I have you!" he cried. He tried to throw it into his little boat, but the nut fell into the sea. "Well, there are many more nuts in the tree," said Anansi. But the second nut fell into the sea, too. Seven times that happened. Seven good big nuts were in the sea! The wind carried them far far away. The boy cried and cried. But nuts have no ears! They did not come back. Then Anansi went to the forest. He saw a little house there. An old man came out of the house. 


"What do you want here, my boy?" asked the old man. "Do not be afraid of me. Tell me everything." 


So Anansi told him about the famine and about his hungry people. Then he told the old man about the nuts and cried again. 


The old man took Anansi's hand and said, "Don't cry, my boy! I have something for you. It is better than nuts." He went into his house and brought a little pot. "Take it home and give it to your mother. Now you and your people will never be hungry. When your mother wants to make dinner for her family, she must only say: 'Pot, pot, what you did for the old man, please do for me!" 


Anansi thanked him and went quickly away. He came to the little boat, got in, and said at once, "Pot, pot, what you did for the old man, please do for me!" 


And the pot gave him a good dinner. Anansi ate it all and was strong again. He soon came home. But he did not want to give the pot to his mother. "It is my pot. I shall have it and eat when I want to." 


So Anansi put the pot in some dark place of the house and spoke to it when nobody was at home. Every day his mother and his brothers and sisters went out to look for food. 


Anansi did not go with them. He said, "Oh, I am ill. I cannot go." 


When he was at home alone, he ran to his pot and the pot gave him a good dinner. 


Anansi's brothers and sisters grew thinner and thinner every day. But Anansi grew fatter and fatter. 


"Why is he so fat?" one of his brothers asked one day. "I think he has a secret. I shall find it out." 


And the next day he did not go out to look for food with his mother. He stayed at home. Anansi thought that nobody was at home, took his pot and said, "Pot, pot, what you did for the old man, please do for me!" 


And the pot gave him a good dinner. 


His brother listened to the words. Now he knew about the pot and he told his mother about it. The poor woman began to cry. 


"I have a bad son!" she cried. 


That day she told Anansi to go out of the house together with the other children. She stayed at home and asked the pot to give her dinner. 


"How happy my children will be when they come home!" she thought. 


Anansi came home with the other children. Their mother gave them dinner. 


But Anansi said, “I am very ill. I cannot eat it. I shall go to bed." 


But he did not go to bed. He went to the place where the pot was. But the pot was not there! The next day his mother went to the village square with the pot in the hands. She stopped there and began to beat the pot with a little stick. Many people came to the place. Then she said, "Pot, pot, what you did for the old man, please do for me." 


And the pot gave her food! The woman spoke to the pot many times and the pot gave the food to the hungry people. But when she spoke to the pot for the fiftieth time, the pot melted away. There was nothing on the ground in front of the poor woman. Anansi was very angry. He decided to go to the old man again and tell him everything. : 


"He will give me another pot," he thought. 


When Anansi came to the seashore, the little red boat was there. He got into it and soon he came to the old man's house. The old man listened to Anansi's story. 


"I have no pot to give you, my boy, but I'll give you this stick. You say the same words to it, only instead of pot, pot say stick." 


Anansi took the stick and ran to the boat. He could not wait a minute. He said quickly, "Stick, stick, what you did for the old man, please do for me!" 


And the stick did! It beat him on the back, on his fat face, on his fat hands and legs. 


It beat all his fat body! He did not know what to do. He jumped into the water and swam away as quickly as he could. He left the boat with the stick in it. He came home crying like a small child. But he did not tell anybody about the stick. But that was a good lesson to him. People say that now everything he gets he shares with his brothers and sisters and with other people, too. </p>
    
        <h6>Dinner of The Lion</h6>
        <p>There was one place in the Seven Hills which the animals liked very much. There was good water and green grass. But a strong lion lived there. He killed two or three animals every day. 


One day the animals came to the Lion and one of them began to speak, "Oh, dear Lion, it is not good for you to run and hunt all day long in the Seven Hills. We'll send you one animal for your dinner every day." 


"All right," the Lion said, "but you must begin to send me my dinner now. I am hungry. I must have my dinner every day! If you don't send an animal to me every day, I shall kill as many of you as I want!" 


"Don't kill us, dear Lion. We shall send you an animal every day." 


They cast lots and that day it was an antelope who became the Lion's dinner. And every day they sent one animal to the Lion. 


But the animals were not happy. Each of them thought, "Oh, tomorrow my turn will come!" 


One day it was a Hare's turn to be the Lion's dinner. But the Hare was not unhappy. He smiled! "That's good, very good?" the hare said. "Don't be afraid! The Lion will not eat me up!" 


The Hare ran to the river, jumped into the water and then began to roll in the mud. He came to the Lion very dirty. 


The Lion saw him and became angry. "But I don't want that dirty animal for my dinner," he cried. "Oh, dear Lion, I am not your dinner. I had to bring you a big hare. But on my way I met another lion and he took the hare for himself. " 


"Is there another lion in the Seven Hills?" asked the Lion. 


"Yes, there is. He is big and strong. I think he is stronger than you are." 


The Lion became angrier than before and said to the Hare, "Show me that lion!" 


"All right!" said the Hare. "Let us go to him." 


And they went to a big well. The Hare looked into the well and said, "Look, he is there and the Hare is with him." 


The Lion looked into the well. He saw himself and the Hare in the water. He jumped into the well to catch them and never came back! 


The animals were happy. They jumped and danced and thanked the clever Hare. </p>
    
        <h7>The Chicken at The Well</h7>
        <p>"Don't go near the well! Don't play round it!" Mother Hen said to her children. And they never came to the well. But once a little chicken ran to the well and stopped there. "Why is the well so bad?" he thought. "I am here and everything is all right with me. Let me see what is in the well. 



And he jumped up to look into it. And what did he see there? 



He saw another chicken! Our chicken turned his head. The chicken in the well did the same. The chicken jumped. So did the chicken in the well. He became angry with the chicken in the well and decided to have a fight with him. He jumped down into the well. But there was no chicken to fight with, but only water and water. 



He cried, "Help me, help me!" But nobody heard him. He went down under the cold water and nobody saw him again. </p>
    
        <h8>The Feast</h8>
        <p>One a chief decided to give a feast for his people. He sent his men to every village. They told the people to come to the chief’s house and said, "The Chief asks each of the men to bring one bottle of palm wine and pour it into a pot at the door." 


The day of the feast came. People put on their best clothes and walked to the chief’s house with their families. They stopped at the door of the chief’s house and poured their bottles into a very big pot at the door. 


There was a man who wanted to go to the feast very much. But he had no palm wine at home. His wife said to him, "You must buy some palm wine." 


But the man answered, "What? No. I don't want to buy wine for a feast that is free. No. No!" 


He thought a little and then said, "Hundreds of people will bring their Wine and pour it into the pot. A bottle of water cannot be bad for so much wine." 


And so he went to the feast with a bottle of water. He poured his bottle into the pot as other people did. Then he sat down at the table with all the other people and waited for the glass of palm wine which he liked so much. 


The chief said, "Let's drink wine, dear guests!" All the guests took their glasses. But what they drank was not palm wine, but water! 


So our man was not the only one who thought, "A bottle of water cannot be bad for so much wine." </p>
    
        <h9>The Happy Man</h9>
        <p>Many, many years ago in North Africa there lived a chief. He was very rich and had many wives and children. But he was not happy. He thought, "I have everything. But that does not make me happy. What must I do to be happy? I don't know." 


Once he shouted angrily to his servants, "Why can't I be happy? What must I do to be happy?" 


One of his servants said, "Oh, my Chief! Look at the sky! How beautiful the moon and the stars are! Look at them and you will see how good life is. That will make you happier." 


"Oh, no, no, no!" the chief answered angrily. "When I look at the moon and the stars I become angry. Because I know I cannot get them." 


Then another servant said, "Oh, my Chief! What about music? 


Music makes a man happy. We shall play to you from morning till night and music will make you happy. " 


The chief’s face became red with anger. "Oh, no, no, no, no!" he cried. "What a silly idea. Music is fine. But to listen to music from morning till night, day after day? Never! No. Never!" 


So the servants went away. And the chief sat angrily in his rich room. Then one of the servants came back into the room and made a bow, "Oh, my Chief," he said, "but I think I can tell you something that will make you very happy." 


"What is it?" asked the chief. 


"It is very easy to do," said 'the servant. "You must find a happy man, take off his shirt and put it on. Then his happiness will go into your body and you will be as happy as he!" 


"I like your idea," said the chief. He sent his soldiers all over the country to look for a happy man. They went on and on. But it was not easy to find a happy man in the chief’s country. But one day the soldiers found a man in a small village who said, "I am the happiest man in the world." 


He was poor. But he always smiled and sang. The soldiers brought him to the chief. "At last I shall be a happy man!" said the chief and took off his shirt at once. "Bring the man in!" The door of the chief’s room opened. A small, dark man with a happy smile walked in. 


"Come here, my friend!" said the chief. "Please take off your shirt!" The happy man with a little smile came up to the chief. The chief looked at him and saw what did he see? The happy man, the happiest man in the world, had no shirt! </p>
    
        <h10>A Cat and Her Strong Friends</h10>
        <p>Once there lived a cat. She thought, "The lion is the strongest of all the animals. It is good to have strong friends. I shall go to the lion and make friendship with him." 


She did so and the lion and the cat were friends for many, many days. 


Once they went for a walk together and met an elephant. The lion began to fight with the elephant and the elephant killed him. 


The cat was very sorry. "What shall I do?" she thought. 


"The elephant was stronger than the lion. I shall go to the elephant and make friendship with him." 


She did so and they were friends for many, many days. 


Once they went for a walk and met a hunter. The hunter shot at the elephant and killed him. The cat was sorry, but she thought, "The man is stronger than the elephant, I see." 


So she went up to the hunter and asked, "May I go with you?"


"All right, let us go home together," he said. 


They came to the man's home. His wife met him and took his gun from him. The cat saw that and thought: "Oh, the woman is the strongest of all! She can take the hunter's gun from him, and he does not fight with her. He does not even say a word!" The man sat down at the table and the woman went to the kitchen. The cat went to the kitchen, too. She decided to stay with the woman forever. That's why you always see a cat in the kitchen at a woman's feet. </p>
    
        <h11>The Wise Dog</h11>
        <p>One day nine dogs went out to hunt. They met a lion. He said "I am hunting too. I am very, very hungry. Let us hunt together." 


So the dogs and the lion hunted together all day. 


They caught ten antelopes. 


Then the lion said" Now we must divide this meat." 


One of the dogs said "Why, that's easy. We are ten, and we have ten antelopes. So, each of us will have one antelope." 


The lion became very angry. He hit the poor dog and blinded him. The other dogs did not say a word. But then one of the dogs said, "Our brother was wrong. We must give nine antelopes to King Lion. Then they will be ten together. And we dogs shall take one antelope and we shall also be ten together." 


The lion liked his answer and asked the dog "Who taught you to divide like this? You are a wise dog." 


The dog answered "Oh, King Lion, you hit our brother and blinded him. That blind brother taught me, King Lion!"  </p>
