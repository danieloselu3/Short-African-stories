    <h2>The Chicken at The Well</h2>
<p>"Don't go near the well! Don't play round it!" Mother Hen said to her children. And they never came to the well. But once a little chicken ran to the well and stopped there. "Why is the well so bad?" he thought. "I am here and everything is all right with me. Let me see what is in the well. 



And he jumped up to look into it. And what did he see there? 



He saw another chicken! Our chicken turned his head. The chicken in the well did the same. The chicken jumped. So did the chicken in the well. He became angry with the chicken in the well and decided to have a fight with him. He jumped down into the well. But there was no chicken to fight with, but only water and water. 



He cried, "Help me, help me!" But nobody heard him. He went down under the cold water and nobody saw him again. </p>
